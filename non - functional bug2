Non-Functional Bug 2: Security â€“ Missing HTTPS/SSL Configuration
Bug Description: The website is not using HTTPS, making user data vulnerable to interception during transmission, especially during login and transactions.

Fix: Enforce HTTPS by configuring the web server to redirect HTTP to HTTPS and enabling SSL certificates.

<!-- Force HTTPS Redirection (Apache .htaccess example) -->
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
  RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</IfModule>

<!-- Security Headers -->
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
  Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com"
</IfModule>
