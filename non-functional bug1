Non-Functional Bug 1: Performance â€“ High Page Load Times Due to Uncompressed Images

Fix: Implement image compression and lazy loading to reduce load times.
html

<!-- Optimized Image with Lazy Loading -->
<img src="images/attraction-banner.jpg" alt="Attraction Banner" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600">

<!-- Add CSS for further optimization -->
<style>
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
  }
</style>


Explanation:By setting loading="lazy", images will only load when they appear in the viewport, reducing the initial load time.
